    <h2>Security info</h2>
    <p>If you're trying to see if there's some goofy stuff in the script, you can look in the 'setup_drive.sh' because that's where all the code is. Also, there is no JavaScript on this website. Plain HTML and shell code.</p>

    <h2>How to access the drive server?</h2>
    <p>Copy paste the program listed below</p>
    <p>curl -O http://.static.com/path/to/setup_drive.sh;
chmod +x setup_drive.sh;
./setup_drive.sh</p>

    <h2>Why static domain?</h2>
    <p>I'm not getting paid for making these so of course I won't spend any money for a custom domain hosting. I'm just making these because I just wanted to.</p>
